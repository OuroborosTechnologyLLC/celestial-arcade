# JWT Secret Key (REQUIRED for authentication)
# Generate a secure random string at least 32 characters long
# Example: openssl rand -base64 32
# Or: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-minimum-32-characters

# JWT Token Expiration (default: 1h)
# Access token lifetime - how long before needing to refresh
# Format: 15m, 1h, 24h, etc.
# Shorter = more secure (forces frequent session validation)
# Recommended: 1h (good balance of security and performance)
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h

# Refresh Token Expiration (default: 365d)
# How long users stay logged in before needing to re-authenticate
# As long as user is active, they stay logged in indefinitely
# Should be much longer than JWT_EXPIRATION
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=365d
